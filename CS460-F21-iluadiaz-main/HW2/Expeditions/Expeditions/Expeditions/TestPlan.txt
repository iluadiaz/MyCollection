1. I would have to develop the moqing for the database.
2. I would have to generate some fake data.
3. I would have to test all methods added to PeakRepository, and ExpeditionRepository.
4. I must test the methods in my view models, such as the ParseIt method found in CreateViewModel.
5. My test would include invalid input from the user, such as leaving the agencies entry empty, however in this case I would moq that by adding a blatantly invalid entry.
