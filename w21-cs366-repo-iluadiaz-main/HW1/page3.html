            <h1 class="mainIdea2">Stats play a huge role in pokemon. Natures effect those stats, as well as EV's. Its best to have your pokemons EV's go toward a stat that the pokemon needs in order for it to do its job
                as efficiently as it can.

            <li><p class="pink">Azumarill can be a slept on power house. If you get the max amount of EV's
                 put into its attack, have the huge power ability, and use bellydrum, you can sit at a WHOPPING 1788 attack! This is what you call min-maxing. It means you make sure
                 the stats you are working with are set so that the pokemon can specialize on one thing. In this cake Azumarill is a bulky sweeper, but with Aqua jet's +1 priority, it becomes a fast sweeper.

            </li>

            <li><p class="pink">Typically you will want to have all your pokemon to specialize in one thing. If you have a pokemon that utilizes special attack over attack, you would want it to have its 
                Ev's fill the special attack stat. If the pokemon is slow, your best bet is to fill health, otherwise, if its fast you fill its speed.
            </p.pink>
            </li>



            <li><p class="pink"> Dragapult is what you call a fast physical sweeper. It has High speed and Attack. Its Ev's should be spread accross Attack, and Speed. Its nature would have to be adamant,
                which boosts attack and lowers special attack,or jolly, which lowers special attack and increases speed. It is important that you pick natures that boost a stat used by the pokemon and lowers a stat not relevant to its purpose.
