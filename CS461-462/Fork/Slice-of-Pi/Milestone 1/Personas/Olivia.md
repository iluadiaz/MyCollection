Olivia Moore is a 33-year-old real estate agent, wife, and mother of 2. Her job requires her to frequently do research on neighborhoods to ensure a house can be sold at a certain price. Often, the research ends up being incomplete: Some crimes don't get reported by news outlets, or are otherwise hard to find online. This has sometimes resulted in houses getting resold within 3 months, and unhappy clients.

Olivia can use [Real Estate Project] to get a more complete picture of a house's worth based on its neighborhood and recent crime activity. This makes her job easier, since it uses the federal crime API to get a more complete picture of what a neighborhood is like. It also provides an estimated house value, giving her a better idea of what the house in question can sell for, and therefore how much commission she can make.

Thanks to [Real Estate Project], Olivia's quality of work has improved significantly. Clients are now much happier with the houses they get, and Jane's income is more consistent.
