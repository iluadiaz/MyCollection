For the real estate entrepreneur, or potential home buyer, Dream Real Estate is a product that will provide a streamlined approach to searching for homes in a good neighborhood. 
The application will provide users with visual representation of the value shifts, work done, and other information about the history of the home. This application will provide real 
estate agents with niche data to better serve home buyers, and home buyers themselves with a tool to better inform themselves about the home and the community it belongs too. 
Unlike todays modern apps, such as Zillow, this product will offer data on the prevalence of crime that surrounds the home. This currently rare, if not non-existent feature, will give 
users insight to better protect themselves and their families by mitigating exposure to the type of crime theyâ€™re most vulnerable too.  For example, if someone is trying to avoid 
communities with high rates of break-ins. That individual will be able to see the number of breaks-ins that have occurred in throughout the year, or for more information, the 
history of break-ins in the community. This is achieved by the applications capacity to access multiple crime APIs such as the FBI crime data explorer API. With this in mind, 
we hope to provide everyday people with the means to find good communities.
